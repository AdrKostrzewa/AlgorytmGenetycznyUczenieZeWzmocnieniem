#A This is the list of characters we sample from to produce random strings
#B This is the string weâ€™re trying to evolve from a random population
#C We set up a simple class to store information about each member of the population
#D This method will compute a similarity metric between two strings, giving us a fitness score
#E This method will produce an initial random population of strings
